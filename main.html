	<div class = "rightText">
		To achieve excellence in engineering, we offer personalized service to every client, working with the entire project team to develop a unique solution for each project. We get involved in the design process early and begin by actively listening to our client's needs. From there, we have developed an iterative design process that requires working closely with the project team to achieve a well-coordinated, integrated design. 
		<BR> <BR>
		Our project managers are both technical experts and exceptional communicators, allowing them to work effectively with owners, developers, architects, and other consultants. Our working principals oversee this process to ensure that the project team's original goals are met. It is through this collaborative and holistic project approach that we achieve excellence in engineering design.
